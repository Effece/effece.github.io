				<h1>Videos</h1>
				<h2>[2022] Best recorded time: 21.14</h2>
				<p>OLL skip at the end. PB dropped to 18.56 around that time, but this wasn't recorded. Those weren't on officially generated scrambles.</p>
				<video controls>
					<source src = "videos/21_14.mp4" type = "video/mp4" />
				</video>
				<h2>[2022] Good 2x2 time</h2>
				<p>Though it wasn't performed on an official scramble, this is a good 2x2, between 4 and 5 seconds. Didn't time it well, timer should start with hands off the cube.</p>
				<video controls>
					<source src = "videos/2x2_4or5.mp4" type = "video/mp4" />
				</video>
				<h2>[2024] Two angles 3x3 solve in 26 seconds</h2>
				<p>A 2024 solve which used two different angles (also on the magnet cube). Done during a recording session.</p>
				<video controls>
					<source src = "videos/26_twoangles.mov" type = "video/mov" />
				</video>
				<h2>[2022] 12 seconds F2L</h2>
				<p>Very good F2L time.</p>
				<video controls>
					<source src = "videos/F2L_12.mp4" type = "video/mp4" />
				</video>
				<h2>[2021] Almost sub 1 minute</h2>
				<p>When still using the beginner method and official Rubik's Cube model, I got this time of around 1:06. Got the sub around the same time.</p>
				<video controls>

				<h2>[2024] <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXUuncYsEUbLg4eKgpu-clZjkSLaH5udG">Playlist</a></h2>
				<p>Videos recorded, a few "How I solve the Rubik's Cube" archives and practicing algorithms. Utilizes the <a class = "insideLink" href = "algstream.html">recording</a> page.</p>
